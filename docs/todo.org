* SORE todo list
** TODO Better error handling for some classes
   use exceptions rather than error flags in some classes so
   construction of classes either succeeds or throws
** TODO Fix Batching Geometry Manager
   need a geometry manager that batches geometry to improve draw call
   performance
** TODO Get rid of DLL interface warnings in MSVC
** TODO Add some basic rendering perf statistics to engine
   ideas: 
   - % of state changes due to state changes, vbo switching,
     not-adjacent indices
   - already have polygon/draw calls...
   - pipeline renderer: get information on how much time spent
     rendering each pipe
