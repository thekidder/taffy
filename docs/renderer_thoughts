Renderer design:
Buffer: 
  Contains a (possibly shared) chunk of geometry or index information.
GeometryChunk:
  Contains multiple Buffers
Renderable:
  Composed of a GeometryChunk, shader, textures, and transformation.
  Is sortable -  contains a key that implements sorting (see below)

GeometryProvider:
  Object that defines: 
    Projection for the geometry to be rendered
    Callbacks for added, removed, changed objects

Renderer:
  On a GeometryProvider callback:
    Rebuild or refresh affected VBOs
    Two options: 
     Do a complete rebuild each time, or:
     Find the minimum that has to be changed, and change it
  Per Frame:
    For the current state: render all VBOs

Current issues:
  where to store transformations?
    use a shared_ptr
        
      


Renderer sorting:

key: 32-bits
3 bits: layer (example: HUD, game, etc)
2 bits: translucency
  opaque
  additive-translucency
  subtractive-translucency
12 bits: depth sorting
6 bits: shader
9 bits: texture
