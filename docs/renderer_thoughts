Class to render 3-demensional geometry and effects. Does not manage
2-demensional information - HUDs, GUIs

description/methods

SetCamera(Camera camera) - sets the viewing position for the renderer

two methods for rendering operation: polymorphism: all renderable
geometry inherits from a Renderable class, which implements at least
method Render().  each separate geometry class implements this in a
specific way non-polymorphism: renderer class implements various
pipelines for different renderable geometry
	
the polymorphism route is easier to maintain, and more easily extended
(especially with dynamically loaded libraries). however, it most
likely will incur a large performance hit, and therefore the
non-polymorphism route will be implemented for the renderer

--------------- 
the bigger question (after some research and figuring
out that performance is probably not a issue) is which method is
better: the renderer taking care of all drawing and thus decoupling
the objects from it, or letting the objects have full control of
drawing

renderer contains either one or multiple queues of renderable
objects. if there is only a single queue, objects would have to
inherit from a base class and be dynamically converted - could be
costly. otherwise, there will be multiple queues for each object
type. the downsides to this are keeping track of render order
(probably not important), and again, extensibility.
