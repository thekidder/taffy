* outfile support for SORE_FileIO
** recognize when to write to straight file/package
   needs support in PackageCache; determine if filename is in existing
   package, write accordingly
** packages:
*** writing to a package is hard
    files within a package have a maximum length, must rewrite
    everything after that if we overflow that length -> not easy to
    avoid lots of unneccesary writes
*** writing to compressed file is hard
    zlib has on-the-fly compression support? probably not...
    lends support to writing to temporary file before writing whole
    package out
*** idea: write to temp file
     on a flush calculate sizes/offsets and write whole package
**** idea: transaction support
     use transactions to recover from crash/failed temporary write ->
     package write 
     do this on sore package reading to provide support in any sore app
